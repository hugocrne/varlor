# Workflow Status Template

# This tracks progress through BMM methodology Analysis, Planning, and Solutioning phases.
# Implementation phase is tracked separately in sprint-status.yaml

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Initial Status (before completion):
#   - required: Must be completed to progress
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - recommended: Strongly suggested but not required
#   - conditional: Required only if certain conditions met (e.g., if_has_ui)
#
# Completion Status:
#   - {file-path}: File created/found (e.g., "docs/product-brief.md")
#   - skipped: Optional/conditional workflow that was skipped

  # Pré requis
  - document-project: docs/project-scan-report.json

  # Phase 0: Discovery (Optional - User selected)
  - brainstorm-project: skipped
  - research: skipped

  # Phase 1: Planning
  - prd: docs/prd.md
  - validate-prd: skipped (optional)
  - create-ux-design: docs/diagrams/wireframe-2025-12-05.excalidraw (partial - wireframe created, full UX documentation pending)

  # Phase 2: Solutioning
  - create-architecture: docs/integration-architecture.md
  - create-epics-and-stories: docs/epics.md
  - test-design: docs/test-design-system.md
  - validate-architecture: skipped (optional)
  - implementation-readiness: docs/implementation-readiness-report-2025-12-05.md

  # Phase 3: Implementation
  - sprint-planning: pending (requires completion of critical gaps)

# Overall Progress
  - Phase 0 (Discovery): 100% complete (skipped by user choice)
  - Phase 1 (Planning): 90% complete (UX design partially done - wireframe created)
  - Phase 2 (Solutioning): 100% complete (all required workflows done)
  - Phase 3 (Implementation): 0% complete (blocked by critical gaps)

# Critical Gaps Remaining
  1. Complete UX Design Documentation:
     - Wireframe created: docs/diagrams/wireframe-2025-12-05.excalidraw
     - Missing: Component specifications, user flows, accessibility standards
     - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

  2. WebSocket Infrastructure Design:
     - Required for: Epic 2 (Real-time Collaboration)
     - Missing: Socket.IO integration patterns, CRDT implementation
     - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

  3. API v2 Specification:
     - Required for: Epic 4 (Developer Platform) and Epic 9 (Embedded Analytics)
     - Missing: OpenAPI specification, authentication patterns
     - Estimated effort: 3-4 days

# Next Steps
  1. Execute /create-ux-design to complete UX documentation
  2. Create WebSocket architecture design document
  3. Develop API v2 OpenAPI specification
  4. Execute /sprint-planning to begin implementation phase
