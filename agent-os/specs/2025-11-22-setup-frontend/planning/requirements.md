# 🧠 Varlor — Frontend Setup (Stack Only)

## 📌 Purpose

Initialize **only** the technical stack for the Varlor frontend—no layouts, no pages, no API integration, no design system.  
Just a clean, modern environment ready for further development.

## 📁 Frontend Location

The frontend project is located in:

```
varlor/app
```

---

## 🚀 Technology Stack

The setup must include:

- **Next.js 16.0.3**
- **App Router**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1**
- **Shadcn/ui**

## 📝 Summary

No application structure, visual design, or functional features are added at this stage.

The next phase will introduce the application architecture (layout, routing, design system, pages, etc.).
